Lua-eco is a Lua interpreter with a built-in event loop for scheduling lightweight coroutines automatically, enabling efficient concurrency in Lua. Build high-performance, scalable applications.

Lua-eco also provides some modules for you to build applications quickly:

* `log`: Provides logging functionality for Lua-eco applications, allowing you to log messages at different severity levels and output them to various destinations.
* `time`: Provides a Lua interface, allowing you to get current time, sleeping, performing timer operations.
* `file`: Provides a Lua interface, allowing you to read and write files, traverse directory and perform other file-related operations.
* `sys`: Provides access to various system-level functionality, such as process id, system information, and allows you to execute shell commands while obtaining their exit status as well as their standard output and standard error output.
* `socket`: Provides a low-level network socket interface for Lua-eco applications, allowing you to create and manage network connections. Includes tcp, tcp6, udp, udp6 and unix.
* `ssl`: Provides SSL/TLS support for Lua-eco applications, allowing you to establish secure connections to remote servers.
* `http/https`: Provides a HTTP client and server implementation for Lua-eco applications.
* `websocket`: Provides a WebSocket client and server implementation for Lua-eco applications, allowing you to build real-time web applications.
* `mqtt`: Provides an implementation of the MQTT 3.1.1 protocol for Lua-eco applications.
* `dns`: Provides a DNS client implementation for Lua-eco applications, allowing you to perform DNS lookups and resolve domain names.
* `ubus`: Provides a Lua interface to the [ubus] system in OpenWrt, allowing you to interact with system services and daemons.
* `sync`: Provides operations for synchronization between coroutines.
* `channel`: Provides a mechanism for communication between coroutines by sending and receiving values.
* `netlink`: Provides operations for inter-process communication (IPC) between both the kernel and userspace processes.
* `nl80211`: Show/manipulate wireless devices and their configuration.
* `termios`: Bind unix API for terminal/serial I/O.
* `ssh`: Bind libssh2.
* `packet`: For low-level packet construction and parsing.

Would you like to try it? Kinda interesting.

```lua
#!/usr/bin/env eco

local time = require 'eco.time'

eco.run(function(name)
    while true do
        print(time.now(), name, coroutine.running())
        time.sleep(1.0)
    end
end, 'eco1')

eco.run(function(name)
    while true do
        print(time.now(), name, coroutine.running())
        time.sleep(2.0)
    end
end, 'eco2')
```
